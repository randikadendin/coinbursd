            Cryptocurrency â€“ Along with the development of digital currency technology, it is important for you to understand what cryptocurrency is thoroughly and in depth. Why is that? Because the use of digital currencies is increasingly possible in the future, with various central banks of the world trying to develop it.

<h2>Get to know Cryptocurrencies</h2>
<h3>Definition of Cryptocurrency</h3>

                        <a href="https://affairsmithbloke.com/fxuqmwvy91?key=e840e938813350bc4bfe6916b8475137" target="_blank"><button id="download" disabled>Download</button></a>

            <p>
Cryptocurrency is a digital currency that functions as a medium of exchange, unit of account, or store of value, but does not have legal tender status. The name cryptocurrency itself comes from a combination of two words, namely the word cryptography which means secret code, and currency which means currency.

The concept of cryptography has been known since the era of World War II. At that time, Germany used cryptography to send secret codes so that they were not easily read by the opposing party.

Although cryptocurrency has been developed since the 1990s, it was only in 2008 that it became known to the global community. Several types of crypto assets are currently being used, including Litecoin, Ethereum, Monero, Ripple, and of course Bitcoin. There are currently over 10,000 crypto assets in circulation worldwide, and this number will continue to grow in the future.

Cryptocurrencies are also based on blockchain, a system that records transactions across computer networks to maintain traceability and security. This makes it possible for cryptocurrencies to be decentralized. Therefore, no individual company, such as the government or central bank, has to issue it or can change it.
            </p>
<h2>How Does Blockchain Work?</h2>
<p>
Blockchain itself is a type of digital record keeping system that verifies, records, identifies, and stores important information, such as date, time, amount, or anyone who conducts cryptocurrency transactions in virtual blocks using a decentralized worldwide computer network. To distinguish between blocks, each block in the chain has an identifier known as a hash.

  More specifically, here's how blockchain works in a simple way:</p>
<p>
When you transfer Bitcoins to other cryptocurrency wallets, information from your transactions, such as nominal amount and time will be recorded in a block which then becomes a chain or record of your transactions.
    Furthermore, with a decentralized computer network system around the world. Then the transaction verification process will occur.
    With so many transactions taking place, the virtual blocks that cover each transaction are given the ability to identify each block automatically which is called a hash (auto-identifying code).
    After each block generate a hash. The chain of blocks is also placed into the blockchain as a record of all the transactions you make.
            </p>
            <p>
So, so that we can understand better. Let's get acquainted with some important terms in cryptocurrency.</p>

            <h2>Important terms in Cryptocurrency</h2>

            <p>Here are other important cryptocurrency terms that you need to know.</p>
<h3>a. Altcoins (Alternative Coins)</h3>
<p>
Alternative coin is another type of cryptocurrency that is also blockchain-based and inspired by Bitcoin. Examples include Litecoin (LTC), Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), and Dogecoin.</p>
<h3>b. Bullish/Bearish</h3>
<p>
A term for traders of cryptocurrencies and other types of investments or markets (stocks, bonds). Bullish is a call for traders who think Bitcoin is going up. While the Bears think otherwise, they believe that the Bitcoin price will eventually fall.
            </p>
<h3>c. Crypto Exchange</h3>
<p>
Just like trading stocks through an exchange on the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq. Cryptocurrencies are traded on a platform that connects buyers and sellers.
            </p>
<h3>d. Forking</h3>
<p>
Forking occurs when you make a copy of the blockchain code, and update your cryptocurrency network by modifying it. Simply put, forking is the fork that occurs in the blockchain and forms a new crypto asset.
            </p>
            <h3>e. Token</h3>
<p>
Coins in each cryptocurrency are considered tokens. More specifically, each coin (token) is a digital code that represents a small part of the cryptocurrency being traded.
            </p>
<h2>Cryptocurrency Types and Categories</h2>
            
<p>
The cryptocurrency universe is of course very large. How not, there are about 10,000 more crypto assets contained in it.

Of the many crypto assets in circulation. Maybe, you already know the king of crypto assets, namely Bitcoin. Or Ethereum, the main altcoin after Bitcoin. However, there are also other types of cryptocurrencies that have different names and you may not have heard of before.

With the above circumstances, it must make you wonder: Are all cryptocurrencies the same? What makes one crypto asset different from another?

The answer, of course, is that all cryptocurrencies are not the same. Each crypto asset has different characteristics and uses. Therefore, in cryptocurrency there is a categorization for crypto coins based on their use value.

However, before we go there, it helps us understand the reasons behind the large number of crypto assets in circulation today.
            </p>
<h2>The Reasons Behind The Many Types Of Cryptocurrencies</h2>
<p>
In 2008, we only know one cryptocurrency. None other than Bitcoin, the first crypto asset developed by Satoshi Nakamoto.

At that time, the developer, whose identity is unknown, hoped that Bitcoin could become a digital currency that could be used for online transactions. All transactions are built on a blockchain, a technology that allows users to transact and utilize financial services without having to go through the role of intermediaries, for example in conventional financial services.

This technology is also quite safe. Although freely accessible, blockchain technology can only be changed through one particular algorithm. For example, Bitcoin's algorithm is named Proof of Work.

However, over time, blockchain technology is not only used for transactions. However, it is also used for financial services projects, personal data storage, machine learning, and more. Therefore, each of these blockchains eventually has its own cryptocurrency that functions as the driving force for the technology.

In essence, today's crypto assets represent the diversity of their respective blockchain functions. However, there are several other reasons that underlie the many types of cryptocurrencies today.
